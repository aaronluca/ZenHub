Suggestions for the possible improvement of the website and blog:

1) For the popular tags section, currently the html element is <aside class='widget widget-tags>
It will be helpful if there is a unique and meaningful id to be added for that element.

2) On the blog page, the top section which includes the Blog Homepage link and the Zenhub picture, the element is <div id='primary' class ='content-area'>
It will be helpful if there is a unique and meaningful id to be added for that element.
